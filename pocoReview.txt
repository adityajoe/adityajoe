hey what's up guys will here for gsmarena last year's poco x3 nfc was quitea popular value-based mid-rangerand now a few months later we have asequel the poco x3 prois this one worth upgrading to let'sfind out in our full review[Music]the poco x3 pro is a mid-range devicethat's all about bang for your buckjust like its predecessor the poco x3and fc and the pocos all the way back tothe originalf1 the x3 pro is quite similar to thenfcboth looks wise and feature wise thedesign is pretty much identicalwith the distinctive stripe accents andthe large poco logothe back and frame are made of plasticand the finish looks nicethe horizontal camera bump is anotherunique touch the x3 pro fits nicely inhand but it's not the slimmest or mostlightweight offer aroundalthough it's plastic the phone doesn'tfeel cheap and you do get ip53 rateddust and splash resistance just likelast yearcompared to the previous model thebiggest upgrade you'll find on the x3pro is the chipsetit's the new flagship grade snapdragon860built on the seven nanometer processit's actually very similar to thesnapdragon 855 plus of 2019's flagshipsalthough it doesn't offer 5gconnectivity performance is much betterthan the snapdragon 732gin the poco x3 nfc and actually it blowsall of the mid-range processors out ofthe watercpu and gpu performance are stellar andevery bit flagship worthythis is probably the most powerful phoneyou'll find in this price rangeand thanks to an adequate cooling systemyou can play games without worryingabout overheating and throttlinganother small upgrade over the x3 nfc isin the storage optionsyou can have more storage on board 128or 256 gigsand that's still expandable through ahybrid slotpretty much everything else about the x3pro is the same as last year's modelexcept for the cameras but i'll get tothat in a bitfor example you get basically the samescreen here it's a 6.67 inch ips lcdwith a 1080p resolution and fast 120hzrefresh ratethere is gorilla glass 6 not 5 on topthoughthe fast refresh rate adds some extrasmoothness when swiping and scrollingand this is adaptiveit will go down when you're notinteracting with the screen there's alsoa fast 240hz touch sampling rate forextra responsivenessthere is one thing we noticed on the x3and fc and you see it again heresome ghosting and smearing when you'rescrolling fast at the high refresh ratethese little stutters are caused by alower pixel response time on thesescreensbesides that the display is alrightthere's plenty of sharpness at thisresolutionand blacks are deep enough and colorscan be made to be super accurate if youtweak them in settingsbrightness is decent it maxes out ataround 460 nits with the sliderand boosts to 530 nits in auto mode inbright conditionswhich for some reason is less than onthe x3 and fcand you don't get official hdr10 supporton the x3 profor audio the poco x3 pro brings back abalanced stereo speaker setuploudness measures good in our charts andthe sound quality is satisfyingwith good mid and high tones but notmuch bassthere's also a 3.5 millimeter jack andsupport for fm radiotoo when headphones are plugged in youcan wake up and unlock the x3 pro withthe side mounted fingerprint readerpower button it's well placed andincredibly fast and accuratethe interface of the x3 pro is poco'sflavor of miui 12 over android 11.this is an interface we've seen quite abit of both this yearand last one of the more interestingfeatures is the ability to split thenotification shadeinto a notification panel and a controlpanelyou also get an app drawer that willorganize your apps into categorieson the poco you can disable the drawerlike you can on xiaomi's redmi phonesand you get an ir blaster which can sendsignals for controlling appliancesand there's nfc support here too forcontactless payments and connectivitythe poco x3 pro has a 5 160 milliamphour batterythe same size as the x3 nfc it was ableto score anawesome 112 hour endurance rating in ourtestsregardless of screen refresh rate thisis a little less than what we got on thex3 nfcmaybe because of the high poweredchipset for charging you get the same 33watt adapter in the box that wasincluded last yearwith it we were able to charge the x3pro from zero to 50 percent in half anhourjust a hair less than the previous modelnow finally onto the cameras whichrather than an upgrade are actually adowngrade resolution wisecompared to the poco x3 nfc the main camis a 48 megapixel quad bayer oneinstead of 64 megapixels and the ultrawide uses an 8 megapixel sensor insteadof last year's 13 megapixelsthe 2 megapixel macro cam and depthsensor are unchangedhowever even though the resolutions arelower we didn't see a noticeable drop inquality herethe main camera shoots 12 megapixelphotos by default and these are good fora mid-range camerathere's enough resolve detail gooddynamic rangebalance sharpening true to life colorsand low noiseyou don't see a ton of fine detail herethoughportraits are taken with the help of the2 megapixel depth sensorthese are quite nice with good lookingdetail and colorsand proficient subject separation the 8megapixel ultrawide camera takes somevery decent photos with enough detailgood contrast and ok dynamic range thedistortion correction does a nice jobstraightening the corners tooclose up shots taken with the 2megapixel macro cam are hit or misssince focus is fixed here the photos areuninspiring too with poor detail andwashed out colorsin low light the main camera shootsacceptable photos which have low noiseand a bright enough exposurethey are lacking in detail and rathersoft thoughenabling night mode won't drasticallyimprove the qualitybut you do get more balanced photos withlower noisemore saturated colors restoredhighlights and a bit more detailnighttime shots from the ultra widecamera are simply no goodthey are dark smudgy noisy and lackingin detailunlike the poco x3 nfc the x3 procan do night mode on his ultrawidecamera and it gives you pretty usableresultsthey are still soft but they are wellexposed with good color saturationand decent dynamic range selfies aretaken with the 20 megapixel front facingcamand they have good enough detail nicecolors and great contrastthe poco x3 pro can capture videos withits main camera and up to 4k resolutionat 30fpsthese have a good amount of detail greatcontrast accurate colors and wide enoughdynamic rangeunlike the poco x3 nfc you don't havesupport for 4kon the ultrawide cam 1080p clips arepoor in detailbut otherwise the colors contrast anddynamic range are all pretty goodelectronic stabilization can be enabledon either of these camerasand it works in all availableresolutions and frame rates to smoothout wobble and shake in your footageso that's the poco x3 pro it brings thenice features we've already seen on thex3 and fclike a splash proof build a large highrefresh rate lcdstereo speakers a large battery andpretty fast chargingbut now on top of that you get aflagship level chipsetand despite my initial concerns thecamera quality here is pretty comparabletooif you look at the competition at thisprice the only upgrades you could reallyfind are an amoled screenor a higher res camera but neither ofthese would come together with aflagship chipsetoverall the poco x3 pro was a clearupgrade over its predecessorand it isn't even that much moreexpensive it delivers a ton of value andis definitely worth recommendingthanks for watching guys stay safe andsee you on the next one[Music]you
