hey guys this is paige from b1.com andthisis the new poco x3 pro and this is thephone that'sall hyped up because of the fact thatit's said to be the poco f1 successorand that's because it's all about thechipset here i mean the snapdragon 860at rupees 19kalready makes the poco x3 pro a greatvalue for money phonebut is it as good as it seems how doesit compare to thevery good redmi note 10 pro max or eventhe likes of the real me x7well this is a poco x3 pro review solet's find outso starting off i know you guys want toknow all about the high end performanceof the poco x3 proand i'm gonna get to that but first letme just get the design out of the wayso clearly the poco x3 pro looks a lotlike the poco xc that launched last yearbut there is a slight difference see thepoco x3 pro has a plastic bag that'skind of divided into threethe middle with the big poco logo hasthe glossy finish while the sides have amatte finishnow when i first started using the phoneit did feel a little strange becausethere is ahow do i put it a certain frictionbetween the mat and the glossy finishbut yeah i did get used to it so that'sthere apart from that like the poco x3thisis a big and slightly hefty phone i mean9.3 millimeters thicknessand 213 grams of weight make that prettyclearsee the poco x3 pro like the poco f1 ofthe past has a prettybasic functional design if you ask methe redmi note 10 pro max is definitelymore premium with its glass back andit's also lighteranyway i said the design is functionalbecause there's a very rare notificationled right here on the top and yeah it'svery tiny apart from that you get the irblasterright here the headphone jack on thebottomdual sim plus micro sd hybrid slotyou also have the ip53 rating for somesplash resistance and apart from thatthere's dual stereo speakers one speakerat the bottom and one speaker at the topin the earpiece so it's all there and ifyou're wondering about the speakerperformance the speakers here are quiteloudand the secondary speaker in theearpiece offers a fairly good amount ofdepthhowever do note that the secondaryspeaker here isn't quite as loudfor exampleso this is with both the speakers andthis is just the secondary speakerso you have to make sure that whenyou're gaming uh the volume will not bequite as loud because the second speakerthe primary speaker kind of gets muffledup while gamingas for the display it's more or less thesame display as the poco x3a 120 hertz ips lcd with gorilla glass 6which is an upgradenow to be honest a 120 hertz ambulantlike the note 10 pro would have been youknowkiller but the ips lcd here is good ithas good brightness levels so i did nothave any issues with outdoor visibilityit's smooth with the higher refresh ratethe colors look good and the blacks areas good as you can get in an ips lcd inthis segmentplus i remember people talking abouttouch ghosting issues in the x3well i did not notice that in the hdpro's display overall this ips lcdis good no doubts about that but let mejust make this clear that thisis no match to the amoled in the note 10pro or the pro maxnow a few other important display pointsto note there's no issues withhd playbacks and netflix or prime videobut one thing is even though the phonesupports hdr10 i did not notice the hdrtag in movies and shows on netflixso the design and display are out it'stime to talk about the big deal in thepoco x3 prothe performance so let's get the specsout of the waythe powerful snapdragon 860 chipset withthe adreno 640 gpuup to six or eight gigs of lpddr4 x ramand 128 or 256 gb of ufs 3.1 storagenow i know what's the most excitingthing here snapdragon 8 series chipseti mean it's probably the first timesince the poco f1 that a phone brings an8 series chipset under 20know first up let me make this very clearthat the snapdragon 860 isbasically the snapdragon 855 plus i meanjustlook at this yeah there's no differencebetween them whatsoeverthey're basically the same chipset nowthis means that this is an 8 serieschipset froma couple of years back but that's not abad thing becauseit still beats every other mid-rangechipset in the market right nownow here are the geekbench and antutuscores of the poco xc pronow these are some good scores but let'scomparefirst up snapdragon 732 g and the 750gand yeah the 7 series chipsets are noteven close between geekbench or antututhe snapdragon 860 is just way ahead nowhere the scores compared to the slightlymore powerful dimension 800uand yes the snapdragon 860 easily beatsthe density 800 u2so clearly the snapdragon 860 is a beastin this price range no doubts about thatbut how is the real-world performance ofthe poco x3 prowell first up i did a heating andbattery drain sort of stress test on thephonei played cod mobile continuously for anhour on the phone and that's at veryhigh graphics and max frame ratesand the battery drain was around 18which is pretty goodand as for the temperature the phone didget warm especially around the top andof the backof the camera region and that's kind ofexpected the temperature was around 40to 43 degreeswhich is a little hot but it wasn'tunusable or you knowuncomfortable to hold the one thing idid notice is that the phone did cooldown really quickly after i paused thetestwhich might be because of the coldcooling system that poco has talkedabout in the x3 proi also did the cpu throttling test andthe performance was kind of locationthe phone throttled the 64 percent ofits max performancewhich is not poor but not very good aswellnow those are all the tests that i didbut when it comes to dailyday-to-day performance the phone hasbeen pretty consistent for mesee i've been gaming a lot on this phoneand i haven't noticed any major framedrops or stuttersnot gaming performance has been prettysolid too see the point ispeople in my family still use the pocof1 and even though the phone has gottenold it does have a few issues here andthereit remains fairly good in terms ofperformance and that's due to thesnapdragon 845 chipsetand you know what i'm just hoping forthe same in the poco x3 proin the long run anyway there's still alot to talk about this phone first upyes the performance isawesome but i did notice a couple ofweird me up bugs in this phonefirst up when i'm playing a game and iswitch to the home screen the homescreenonce in a while gets stuck like thisanother thing i noticed is thatinstagram did crash for me a number oftimesespecially while viewing stories nowthis probably might be an instagramissue because instagram is said to bevery buggy on androidbut yeah it's something you should knowother than that it's all good it's me uh12 with android and it's me ui for pocosono ads here as for the bloatware they'reobviously xiaomi apps but otherpre-installed apps includeme credit netflix prime video amazonfacebook and linkedinso it's not a lot and they can beuninstalled as for the cameras they'resort of downgraded from poco xt but weall know that numbers don't reallymatter a lotand i say that especially because thecamera performance is pretty good herei certainly had no expectations becausethe whole downgrade to a 48 megapixelsensorbut it did not really feel like adowngrade in good light the x3 pro'scamera takes sharp detail photos thathave nice contrast and kind of look goodi mean this photo is really good rightnow the dynamic range could have been alittle betterbut other than that it's mostlyexcellent in daytime in low light thephone automatically enables the nightmodes for photos of brightbut overall i'd say it's decentish imean the photos are fairly sharp but thedetails are kind of lacking in low lightnow individually the poco x3 pro's maincamera isoverall good and that's the case withmost other xiaomi phones in this pricesegmentin fact when compared to the redmi note10 pro max the poco x3 pro does fairlywellmostly see the note 10 pro max does takethe more richer more pleasing photos atmost timesbut the poco x3 pro is not far behindsometimes it takes the more natural shotthan the redmi which is goodin low light though the redmi note 10pro max is definitely the clear winnerthe note 10 pro max's low light photosare just sharper detailed and overallbetter exposedto be honest it's not a big differencebut quite expectedly the note 10 pro maxhas the better cameraas for the ultra wide angle lens in thex3 pro it's fairly goodthere is distortion in the edges on afew shots and the details are okaybut other than that the colors are wellmaintained and the dynamic range isoveralldecent when it comes to videos this is a4k 30fps video from the phoneand i like it the video is sharp thestability is good enough and even thoughthe contrast seems a bit boostedit's overall pretty good if you'rewondering about the selfies the poco xcpro does add a slight warmth to theselfies but it mostly gets the overallexposure rightalso the details and sharpness are wellon points so no problems heremoving on the battery on the poco x3 prois fairly big and there's also a 33 wattfast charger in the boxnow the battery performance is good inmy usage whichincluded an hour of gaming some googlemaps some calling lotsof youtube social media the onepluswatch which i'm testing connected allthe timei got a screen on time of around five tosix hours which i think is goodas for the charging speed the inbox 33watt charger is pretty fastit takes the phone from 0 to 100 inaround 70 minutes which isfairly fast now a lot of you guys alwaysask us if a phone supports usb powerdelivery chargingand well the poco x3 pro does supportusb pdso you can use other usbc charges tocharge this phonelastly let me answer a few questionsthat you guys asked us on twittercamera aggregation support well yes thepoco x3 has support for cameraaggregationas you can see here the phone isconnected to multiple frequencies herewith the jio sim cardby the way also check with atl andvodafone and yes scatter aggregation isindeed supportcan a transition impact smoothly at maxsettingssee i've never really played junctionimpact but i checked things out bydefault the game is set to mediumgraphicsand i think the game runs fine on that idid try out the highest and highgraphics toobut i noticed some frame drops so mediumit is display visibility under directsunlightbut the display is fairly visible indirect sunlight it's not a problem butif you want to compare things the amoledpanel on the note 10 pro max isa tad bit brighter well it's time forthe verdict so the poco x3 pro starts atrupees 18 triple nine for the six 128 gbvariantand you know what one thing is prettyclear thisis a phone that absolutely destroys thecompetition when it comes to performancejust like the poco f1 see let me justput it straight away if you want themost powerful smartphone in this pricerangethe poco x3 pro is an easy choiceespecially because it gets all the otherbasics right toothe design though kind of big and blandis functionalthe display is a good ips lcd the cameraform is good tooand so is the battery so yeah get thepoco s3 proif you want a good phone with high endgaming performancehowever there's one more option i wantto talk about the redmi note 10 pro maxis also a very good choice it'sobviously not as powerful as the poco x3probut it makes more sense for people whowant a more sleeker more premium lookingphonea 120 hertz amoled panel and slightlybetter camerasso that's my wording but i want to knowwhat you guys think of the poco x3 proand how it compares to the redmi note 10pro
