now this big blue bugger here the pocox3 pro is one of the most excitingsmartphones launched so far in 2021mostly because it's an upgraded versionof last year's excellent poco x3 nfcwhichon the highly scientific steven seagalskill is definitely a full-on properexecutive decision so what you get hereis a small handful of upgrades includingstronger design and a performance boostto compete with recent rivals like theredmi note 10 proof course the burning question is is thepoco x3 pro and under siegeor is it an under siege too well i'vehad my sim slapped in there i've beenusing it as my full-time smartphone foralmost a weekand here's my in-depth poco x3 proreview and for more than the latestgreatest tech please do plug subscribeand hit that notifications bell cheersso gonna start off rather negativelyunfortunately and one thing i reallydon't enjoy about the poco x3 pro is theway it looks which hasn't really changedat all from the oldx3 nfc i know this is a budget blowerbut i found the understated aestheticsof the redmi note 10 promuch more appealing the x3 pro'stwo-tone finish and slightly obnoxiousbrandon definitely ain't doing anythingat all for meespecially as that shiny central stripis a total grease magnetyou can grab the pocket x3 pro in threedifferent colors this bluef is otherwise also black or bronze andi've got to see that darker effortdefinitely looks a bitbetter than this one but the good thingis that the poco x3 prois suitably durable despite being madeof polycarbonateno scratches or scuffs to speak of sofar and if you are paranoid you do atleast get a condom case bundled in thebox there to help keep it extraprotectedit's also good to see the poko hasupgraded the screen protection for thepro model from gorilla glass 5 togorilla glass 6. so this thingis super super safe especially as you'vegot a pre-installed screen protectoron there so it's basically tougher thana pack of petrol station beef jerky at215 grams though the poco x3 pro is alsoa proper heavy sword considering theplastic constructionand factory in the near 6.7 inch designand one-handed play is about asenjoyable as wiping your bun withsandpaperalthough at least me ui 12 does throw ina decent screen shrinking featureand that's just one of many pleasurableadditions that miui adds to that androidfeature set and of course me ui is oneof the more divisive launchers out thereno denying that whatsoever but i gottasay i am enjoying it a hell of a lotmore than i used to just a year or twoagotechnically of course it is the pocolauncher here or me ui for poco but it'sessentially the same miui experiencethat you get on the redmi note 10 prodown to the lovable control center andthose brilliant bonus bits like thevideotoolbox now criticism of me ui tends tofall in one oftwo categories the first being oh it'sfull of ads andno it's really really not the only timei ever saw any adverts of anydescription hereon the poco x3 pro was when i wasinstalling an app from google playand as one console in the comments myunboxing pointed out you can just tap onthis little clog up here and thentick receive recommendations or ratheruntick itand then those will just vanish fromsite and the second criticism is thatmiui is a buggy piece of doggy plop andi gotta say it againyeah sure i saw the occasional littlequirk here in miui but i saw far morebugs in one ui when i was reviewingsamsung's galaxya52 5g and as for iphones don't even getme started on iphones alright so ifyou're going to criticizeme ui you certainly can't be jumping ona samsung and an apple and seeing thatthat is a better experiencei also approve of that edge mountedfingerprint sensor which does the jobbeautifully it's fast it really demandsa second scan unless you've got stickydigits or something and it meant that ireally have to rely on the fierce unlockwhich is really helpful when you'reoutside and masked upwell thankfully the fierce recognitionis really good if you need that too asfor the storage well it comes with 128gigsas standard otherwise you can throw abit more cash pockets weight for 256gigs worthwhich is pretty rare at this sort ofprice point and either way it's ufs 3.1nice and nippy again something foundmore or more premium handsetsand if even 256 gigs isn't enough spacefor you well good news you've got a dualsim setup in here otherwise you can usethat second sim slot to stick in a microsd memory card up to one terabyte insizesurely that's enough space i mean likehow much pawn can one person downloadnow the poco x3 pro's 6.67 inch ipsscreen has been ripped wholesale fromthe x3 nfcserving up the same respectively sharpfull hd plus visualssure it's not an oled screen which iswhat you do get with some rivals likethe redmi note 10 pro and xiaomi's mi 11liteand while this display is apparentlyhdr10 certified you currentlydon't get hdl stream and support withservices like netflixbut all the same contrast is respectableand you can tweak that color outputto suit your liking just bear in mind ofcourse the no oled display means noalways on display feature which is areal shame although you do get thetiniest dinkiest little notificationslike hidden awayin this earpiece speaker up top and likea lot of budget smartphones these days asurprising amount in fact the poco x3pro also supports 120 hertzsuper fast refresher though skimmingaround in the uiis generally a little bit judgy notsuper smooth unfortunately that'sgenerally down to the heaviness of me uimy only real complaint here is thebrightness levels which you know maxthem out you can just about see what'sgoing on on a sunny day and we haveactually been having sunny days here inthe ukhere pip hurrah but unfortunately theauto brightness is about as useful as achocolatesauna i found i was constantly having tomanually tweak it because it was just alittle bit too dimespecially in the evenings you've alsogot a stereo speaker arrangement on thepoco x3 pro and that's pretty bloodygood for the pricethose speakers pack a proper wallet attop volume and without muchdistortion and like a lot of budgetblows you've got a proper headphone jackhere so you can hire that stupid donglythingyou've got full support for high-resaudio on here via the old headphone jackof course and even when streaming viabluetooth5.0 i found i got a really nice crispclear sound coming through as well and apretty decent rangebut the big upgrades here over the oldpoko x3 nfc is that snapdragon 860chipset which is a freshly jiggedversion of the excellent 865 whichpowered a lot of last year's flagshipphonesyou'll get either six or eight gigs ofddr4 ram depending on which model of thepoco x3 pro you pick up my review samplewas the six giga and i'd absolutelybugger all issues with everydayperformance beyond the occasional judowhen flicking through that ui which as imentioned beforeprobably down to the launcher thatadreno 640 gpu can handle pretty mucheverything thrown on its way including atasty bit of gentian impact actionalthough i did have to drop those detaillevels at times to keep the actionsmoothas i did see a fair few frame rate dropson those default medium settingsstill i did find that i could game forhours without stopping thanks to theliquid cool technology stuffed inside ofthe pocket x3 prothis basically consists of a copper heatpipe partnering up with some sexygraphite layer actionplus the 240 hertz touch sampling ofthat display meanssubtle latency when you're swiping andputting the screen in a semi-franticfashion you also get a bevy of gamingfeatures to give you more of a chancewhen you're surrounded by gribblieswho'd like nothing betterthan to turn your face into the nextloin cloth note however that you getsubtle 5g connectivity here on the pocox3 pro still it's a realshame that they haven't chucked that inbut if that's going to be an issue foryou you want that extra bit of futureproofing well they've got likes thexiaomimi 10 tea light which is still anabsolute bloody stunneras for the battery tech it's a 5160milliamp cell no change there versus theolder poco x3 nfcand i found that was absolutelybrilliant even a crazy long day withabout sort of seven to eight hours ofscreen on time playing the immediatestream good bit of camera use all thatgood stuff i still found the poco xt prohad plenty of juice left in the tank atthe end of that one and like quite a lotof other budget smartphones that havebeenlaunched recently you've got 33 wattwires charging and of course no wirelesscharging as well so let's finish up witha squint of that quad lens camera techand the poco x3 prorocks a 48 megapixel primary shooterwhich captures 12 megapixel picks bydefault but they still pack in enoughfiner detail to look good on a bigscreenthe pro usually does a solid job ofkeeping your subject sharpeven when they're squirming around morethan a squirrel with the squitsyou usually get quite natural skin tonesalthough when shooting in brighterdaylight the background will often besaturatedand i did see some lens flare and haloand here and there but for a bunch ofsmartphone these photos look pretty goodto be fairindoor snaps also come out well if yoursubject is perfectly stillwhile the night mode helps to brightenup a dimly lit scene and the ai mode canswap between features to give you thebest possible shot although at timesthis does also really piddle about withthe color reproductionand gives you an artificial lookingimage the addition of a 2-megapixeldepth sensor helps to produce somestunningportrait shots adding in a tweakablebucky effect in the backgroundand you've also got an 8-megapixelultrawide angle lens which again isrespectably efficient for an affordableblower the color reproduction isn'tquite as natural and you will see somedistortion at timesbut it does the job when needed and lastup there's what you do a 2 megapixelmacro lens which produces low res crappylooking photos of things up closeif that's your bag my 4k video samplescame out pretty good on the wholeagain pretty much what i would expectfrom a cheaper handset imagestabilization is decent even at thatultra hd resolution although audiopickup is a little quite in front of thecameramy own voice was certainly picked upmuch clearer and louder where you getthe usual distortion whenever the windstarts gusting and finally around frontyou've got a 20 megapixel selfie shooterand it's absolutelyfine again with those same portraitsmarts as the rear cameven indoors with soft light and you'llget a good looking shot as long as youarestuck still sorry there is what i thinkof the poco x3 pro after using it as myfull-timeblower for about a week or so and igotta say i'm still slightly leaningmore towards the redmi note 10 proabsolutely adore that smartphone butthere's lots to love here and thatsnapdragon 860 chipsetit's good news for anyone who wants togame on something a bit more demandinguh though as i said like some gentianimpact maybea little bit of a stretch unless youreally bump down those detail settingsnow i've just done a full massive budgetcomparison between this bad boy thatredmi note 10 pro the real me 8 pro andxiaomi's
