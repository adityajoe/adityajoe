Super!,Simply awesome device. Performance of this mobile is mind blowing. I'm playing pubg in Ultra HD with extreme smoothness. And I have seen in most of the reviews that the camera quality was bad. So that attaching the photos that I captured on my mobile Poco X3 Pro and added a little adjustments. So that you can decide whether it is good or bad.        You feels like that you're in a mini theatre with these loud stereo speakers. Mobile design also looking good other than in the website or app. ...
Just wow!,"Those who are gonna buy this X3P knows very much about pros n cons of the device, I will not waste your n mine time in writing it. Instead I will share my experience of past 1 week with this X3P.1> First of all I want to clarify that don't compare this device to redmi note 10 series... Both the phones are targeted to different audience. 2> DISPLAY, I would say it's very nice display regarding the price at which you get it with SD860.Yeah I missed the deeper blacks and punchier colours of ..."
Fabulous!,This mobile is easy to feel the power of 120 hz display and the processor also help to speed up process. The only problem is the battery drain quickly. The mobile is always  warm and you feel heat in your hand but the update only fix this issue. I already used poco X3.Poco x3 is slower than this but the battery backup is awesome and the mobile don't get heat for normal usage.So you are a Gamer choose this one but the battery last only 4hrs on heavy game like pubg and cod.you are normal u...

Good choice,"First & Foremost thanks Flipkart for safe & fast delivery, honestly receive the phone in well package fully satisfied with the delivery.My honest review about the phone 😊after using for 1 week. Performance is top notched due 2 Qualcom SD860 Chipset in this price segment no doubt. Battery backup also works good & lasts for a day even if we use continuously by playing games, watching videos,etc. Camera is average not up to the point. LCD display is good but not up to the point it should ..."

Pretty good,Awesome performance Just like Flagship . processor is goodBut too  too too much HEATING ISSUES as well as fast charging is not so fast  who said camera is bad  indeed camera is best performance display everything awesome will edit after 1 month uses
Awesome,"Display is very nice and 120hz is smooth and sharp. Processes is best. Camera is average.Back vibration, so much when music is loud. But if you change the setting it is manageable. I like dual sterio spiker. This phone give fast charge with big battery and meny more feature. This phone is best under 20k.Absolutely worth of money."
Super!,It's processor is amazing which results in a smooth experience. Totally justifies its cost. Battery is powerful. Camera works fine. It's performance is best thanks to its processor. Extra 3k to get this processor is totally worth it. I loved it hopefully you will do too.
Highly recommended,excellent mobile. No lags..smooth display with 120 hz. display is not amoled but the screen quality is amazing. battery performance is superb and charging speed is also great. camera is good. photos have lot of details but video recording need to improve. stereo speakers are excellent
Very Good,"writing after one week1. Performance is best but little bit stuck due to MIUI 12,no matter it is 860 or 888 or 8888888 of 2050 if there is MIUI get ready for lag.2. Camera is not upto mark if you don't want to be insulted don't open it infront of others because people will judge by its price. 3. Display is good but brightness is not enough, previously i have redmi note 7 pro and that is brighter than this but this screen quality is good compare to note 7 pro 4.speaker is best just bes..."
Really Nice,Phone processor is very good but speaker is very bad and aslo phone is very heavy. Battery backup awesome display good camera ok i will not say camera is awesome
Super!,Superb excellent fantastic amazing fabulous... Can't find words to express the feeling of penning this phone.
Perfect product!,"Awesome,👌Very nice quality at mid price smart phone, camera quality also too much surprised, just wow, image captured at different time and location, for the speed, quality and processor of this phone you can't compared to others mid price smart phone ,Came nicely packed but little bit late delivery ,  Never I think delivery was affected due to pandemic ,Just little bit disappointed ( but considerable) with two thing .One this is that the battery consumption and second one is mobile wei..."
Terrible product,Been using it for > 1 month. In call proximity sensor doesnt work. Suddenly call goes on hold or goes to speaker mode due to face contact. To end call i have to click on end 3 times as it keeps jumping up and down. After applying tempered glass the touch response is pathetic. To scroll need to try multiple times as it wont detect scroll action on 1st attempt. Poco f1 was notches better in such simple things. Apart from processor its aa good as a Rs 5k phone. Pathetic.
Just wow!,"Great Product. Just Completed 3 Months using it and it works freakishly smooth. Gaming Experience is the best. Great Speaker & Sensors. It's like I lucked out by buying this Phone. A bit on the heavier side but other than that the processor and sensors balance it out with performance. Some say the Camera is not up to the mark but I would like to differ with them, I really liked the Camera Quality. 120 Hz refresh rate really works like wonder and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 Processor doesn't l..."
im just done with MIUI (POCO launcher),Cameras are below average i would say (don't buy if you care about pictures/photos quality)It do heat up but it has 860 powerful SOC (also it's summer)  Not totally ad-free POCO might enable it in near futurePOCO also can install some apps via OTA updates (just like they did with POCO F1)Great phone for gamers (if they don't care much about privacy/DATA protection and bug/glitchy free UI experience)Battery is great actually and ram management is better than POCO F1 ( i am not gamer but a...
Not good,My 1month review:Lagging too much while gaming  and overheating makes the game more choppy and lagging....  Good for low end gaming not the best in market...   Don't buy this phone trust me. I feel very bad of buying this phone... I'm a gamer I've bought this mobile by seeing youtubers.  All the YouTube's are not genuine..  Don't trust youtubers..
Utterly Disappointed,"Not worth the hype!! Used it for 2 weeks. Firstly, flipkart took 1 week to deliver, which is crazy. Secondly, about the phone, it is really heavy, cameras are average, fast charger doesn't work as claimed, takes about 1 hours 45 minutes to fully charge from zero as opposed to 1 hour claim by the company. Really disappointing.Battery performance is also average. 4.5 hours of screen time only!! Screen is good but I felt it becoming in unresponsive so many times, may be due to the wet finge..."
Nice product,HONEST REVIEW OF POCO X3 PROBroooo ... I just ordered it for pubg... And it's good for it too but .. THERE ARE HEATING ISSUES..IT GETS HEATED UP ONLY IN 1 TO 2 TDM MATCHES...SO IF YOU ARE A GAMER WHO PLAY FOR HOURS...YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT GO FOR IT... ELSE EVERYTHING IS FINE... IT SUPPORTS ULTRA HD+ULTRA IN PUBG...NOW WHAT EXTRA DO WE NEED..??ALSO THERE IS ONE ISSUE WHICH FACED THAT IS IT'S SIM CARD TRAY IS NOT GETTING OUT EASILY....MEANS YOU NEED TO HAVE LONG NAILS AND MUCH FORCE...
Just okay,"This is going to be a long, and tough to write review...First, the pros+ Amazing performance, SD860 works like a charm+ Screen. The LCD panel used is very premium, and has very deep blacks, almost comparable to an AMOLED+ charging. It is fast, and power supply also supports other quick charging setups in samsung amd other phones... (OnePlus  warp charging not supported though)+ 3.5mm jackCons:- camera: even with Gcam, the 48MP camera is mediocre at best. 2MP macro camera is waste. Wi..."
Nice product,"I like the phone, very good hardware. The design on the back looks bad, ngl, but that part is covered by my case, so I'm not complaining. I don't like the software, never liked MIUI, I never intended to use it. My intention was to install a stock android custom rom, which I did, and I'm loving my phone now."
Good,Writing this review helpful for the Poco x3 pro buyer here.I personally used it for 10days.Pros:- Powerful chip 860Soc performance is great.Stereo sound clarity is very good.Network connectivity is good.As heard it's not that bulky but weight balance is very good.Fast charging is nice in 33watt charger.Battery manage 1day with 4 hours online classes.ROM management is proper..Look wise ok.Cons:- Average Camera. Plastic back.Lacking behind in terms of Super Amoled display.Phone i...
Great product,"Awesome phone for gaming performance. Super nice camera quality. Back panel looks is superb. Overall performance best. If you buy this mobile then I suggest to you, you can definitely go to buy this. This phone is best for me. I love it.❤️"
Wonderful,"Gaming is too good on this phone. I was getting constant 85 to 90 fps in 90 fps mode in pubg(patched). Awesome performance for this price.MIUI is like itself , you can turn off ads. I turned off every service and unticked every user agreement of miui except few that are needed and turned off data access for getapps and some other and i haven't got a single ads..btw UI has some bugs  , lags and stutter . miui is just average.Display is good for price .. super responsive and fast.(if display..."

Don't waste your money,Upgrade after redmi note 7 proI was going for samsung but I wanted performance oriented phone so I decided to buy itPros:Performance 💥💥💥Display is goodSpeaker is better than my previous phoneRead and write speed is insaneI can easily notice difference between 120 hz  and 60hzResponse rate is excellent 😊Cons:Device exceeds 40C after normal use ( I think it's due to miui can be fixed after update)Camera quality is 🤢.My redmi note 7 pro has better camera.(It can be improved using...
Really Nice,In gaming perspective u will see stunning visuals in every game as it's meant to do so ! For camera if you click in pro mode you'll get 22mb images and you will be amazed how good the camera is but then a subtle reminder will tell you that you bought it for Snapdragon 860👹Front camera makes your skin tone lighter and doesn't give natural skin tone(had to say this)!!
Worth every penny,"Superb poco x3pro, I order on 4 May got my order 8 May. I was worried coz cash on delivery is not available on my location pin no. But thanks to flipkart deliver my poco x3pro safe I am happy. Poco x3pro got a super processor run every thing smooth including high fps games. This is my one day use review I will update it later if I get any problem hope fully not  👍"
Great product,Overall a good phone with a best processor in this price segment Nice displayDecent camera(It is not a highlight of this phone) Sndp 860 the beast🔥🔥🔥33 W fast chargerThe UI is little laggy but it will be updated All over a nice and a must buy phone
Super!,"Starting with design,i really like the design(my personal opinion)BUILD QUALITY -on front u get CG 6,back u get plastic which quality would have been done better DISPLAY - No issues with the display, that 120hz really amazing.CAMERA - At this price 48mp is not enough,but images are decent and other 3 are not bad and videos are stable u can go up-to 4k 30fps.CHARGING - U get 33 w charger which does it job good. It takes less than an hour to chargerSPEAKERS -speakers are loud and crisp but..."
Simply awesome,"Right time delivery and my pocco x3 pro 6/128 awesome smartphone and camera good , speaker sound very good, and gaming experience very very good"
Delightful,"It's again a Superb Spec phone as POCO F1. Everything is speedy and great so far. Facing bit bugs on MIUI though. Dark mode issues etc. If MIUI cares for a smooth UI experience, it'll be best phone at it's price. A Pro advice :- DON'T UPDATE MIUI PHONES, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LAST LONG. 😃"
Very Good,Camera is not bad. Macro mode works well. Poco should update some features like call recording. Call recording facility is very poor. Call recording quality also very poor. U can't record all calls. You can only record numbers which are not saved in your contacts. For saved contacts you need to add each  number one by one manually. Which is very horrible. I have used redmi note 8pro and 9pro. But some features are missing in Poco x3 pro. I wish poco should modify in it's next update. And I wi...
Worth the money,"I Was using Xiaomi Mi A1 form last 4 years. Experience of switching from old tech to this Powerful new gen tech Machine is on whole new level and i am loving it so much❤️I sacrificed better Camera, Amoled Display & 5G in this price range and picked the performance of SD 860⚡ Thankyou Filpkart !Thankyou Poco !"
Good quality product,Best for gaming and everything else My experience with is good The camera of this device is too good 😊
Good choice,Poco X3 Pro need to optimise battery  otherwise the performance is very good and excellent I am using this mobile 10 days the camera quality is comparatively redmi note 9 Pro is equal when playing pubg almost 4 hours play back and very very important this is value for money
Best in the market!,Just get this !!! You may be disappointed by miui like me that to after just 2daysJust buy this unlock Bootloader install twrp and flash a custom rom at that level this is the best phone out there with a custom rom!!! For camera install gcam with a proper xml and it takes a lot better images than stock rom camera!
Good choice,Superb nice good very good aadipoli awesome wonderful
Terrific,"Awesome phone, just loved it mind-blowing performance and the camera is also great and the battery backup is also great Over all best deal in this budget. Thanks Flipkart Really loved it."
Nice product,"I've used Poco F1📱 for 2 years and upgraded to Poco X3 pro(6gb RAM) 📱 and this is my review after using for 5 days..🔹performance is good (smooth 120hz), 🔹Gaming is good for price, 🔹Camera is average (go for Redmi_Note_10_pro_max if camera is your priority) 🔹 Battery backup is good,🔹 haptic feedback (vibration) is not satisfactory,🔹Speaker volume is Ok,🔹 Phone size is big and somewhat heavy (215g)I will update my review later."
Wonderful,"Been using this phone for over a week now, and after receiving the phone i immediately update it to 12.5, and some people say it would decrease the performance but as far i have experienced the performance is top notch for the price range, what more do you want... Some say it heat too much, but according to my usage i haven't seen the issue regarding overheat. I played BGMI in smooth extreme, so far it didn't cause any heat, just little bit warm, that's common for every device. I played Aspha..."
best at this price,"Pros - Runs almost all heavy games smoothLoud and clear speakersSmooth display, good colorsHuge batteryQuick reliable fingerprint sensorWater resistant to some extentCons - Big and heavy almost like a brick. If you hit some one with this on the head they may die, which you can count as a pro rather than a con is some situations."
Nice product,Perfect smooth for for this prize range.All apps and PUBG works ultra smooth without lagingCamera is Good but not as good as expected (Ok..this is a Gaming Phone) Normal use got 26 hr battery life..Overall satisfied..Value for money..
Best in the market!,"Display is good I am using this phone from 20 days nd this is best gaming phone under 20000, the processor 860 doing it's work well, battery is a downgrade for this phone cuz it's drain faster than any other else , maybe it's because of new miui 12.5 update. I hope this problem maybe fix in future. Nd to be honest I think miui is the only reason which stopping it from shining in the sky . Otherwise this smartphone is a beast . It is a worth of money"
Fabulous!,"VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE,THIS PHONE WONT DISAPPOINT YOU SOME PROS AND CONS ABOUT THE PHONE                                                             Pros- ONE THE BEST PROCESSOR IN THE BUDGET.CAMERA IS GOOD IF U KNOW HOW TO USE IT IN A PROPER WAY ,BATTERY TOP NOTCH,SCREEN SMOOTHER THAN BUTTER AND BATTERY WONT AFFECT TOO MUCH AND YES GOO!

Wonderful,Phone is very good for gaming. I just love it. But you have to sacrifice 5G. And if you want a all rounder phone then you should go for other options.And if you happy with the lil heavy weight and no 5G and  you want beast performance under 20 thousands then must gor for this phone. ✌️
Nice product,"Very nice phone extra fast. very powerful processor, nice build well finished. Powerful stereo speakers. ClearBut. Xiomi made it worst. They made very poor ui it cannot use all the power of processor.. Poor camera ui. Xiomi must work on it. Powerful Battery 8 hrs BGMI play. Full charge in 1 hr. overall very Nice phone."

Great product,The greatest mobile phone ever with super performance as a gaming phone weight is not that heavy like youtubers said . Camera is good quality more than realme 7 best mobile under 20k
Wonderful,Im using this phone from a month and here is my honest reviewFirst of all i bought this phone not for gaming but for future proofing myself cause it comes with SD860 processor . For gamers no doubt this phone is awesome but im giving my review not based on gaming or performance . I saw lots of people in review section complaining about camera quality.  Personally i found the cameras Excellent . Heres my detailed review for camera 1 . Normal lense(48MP) (wide) - 5/5 Pictures are sharp det...
Good choice,Mainly as we know it's a device which totally based on proformance no doubt it's performance is good enough.. Battery life is not as expected it Only get discharged in 5-6 hours in gaming mode.. I'm using it from past 2days..these are things which I mainly felt ☺☺.... Camera is also good as it have pro features which gaves u a pic in hdr mode😇.... Charging is also fast ( full battery charged in 1 hour approx)  weightwise it's not so heavy looks are also cool specially that punchhole camera😂😂
Worth the money,"Go for it if you game, you can call it a gaming phone under 20k, only for gaming nothing else it has got a decent battery life with avg cameras and (2/5) rated display, well we cannot expect amoled with this sd 860 soc in this price  range and there are some glitches with ui, hope they will be fixed in an update and yeah go for it if you need a performance beast at this price range... And I got it for 17k so worth it"
Super!,"Quite amazing product. This is very impressive in this price segment. All aspects are good and I dont even care about  the screen whether its Amoled or IPS and this phone's screen is very nice and I like it.Before buying this phone, I heard a lot about the Battery Charging time and Camera, to be honest, EXCELLENT on both of the segment. I really didn't expect from POCO X series. I am proud to be a member of poco family.And also a big thanks to Flipkart team, its you that made us smile alw..."
Best in the market!,Phone is nice but camera and display quality is average i have been using redmi k20 pro before I don't find this device as good as redmi k20 pro in any thing if you are a gamer you will like it but if you are photoholic then you will not like this device
Good quality product,Best smartphone under 20000And best processor - Snapdragon 860Camera is not goodBut value for moneyAnd best battery backupAnd good display
Wonderful,"Upgraded from my old poco f1 almost same, sound better performance faster and display is bigger than poco f1, camera is average but gets the job done. 120 hz is smooth but consumes more battery. I'm satisfied one more thing dual stereo speakers are loud but the background vibrates little bit"
Simply awesome,Worthy and most noticeable thing in this smartphone is u r getting Snapdragon 860 with smooth performance in between 16000 INR whatever things  need in a  smartphone  u r getting all that in one phone .... Drawback- there is no 5G connectivity if u r searching a 5 g phone then don't go with this and one more missing thing in this i.e amoled display
dont be andh bhakt read it thoroughly..,1 week earlier i broke my rog 2 and after that i got the display price for 16000 then i thought i should get new phone instead of repairing the display..and i went for this device..now i will explain the whole experience that has been changed from this rog to this device...1. It doesnt lies anywhere rog devices..the experience is really worst in miui...its not at all worth it lots of crashes and shuttering as well.2. For 19000 its a good choice but realme x7 max you can get it for 25000 an...
Good choice,There is some bugs here and there in poco launcher however extremely good phone at this price point.. sound is awesome however the back panel vibration is strong while listening to music..performance was amazing as 860 is doing its work.. although the display is not amoled its still looks gorgeous in hdr content and 120 hz refresh rate is cherry on top.. BGMI runs at 90 fps constant after using the patch with hdr ultra settings. Mobile legends run at 60 in ultra settings..genshin impact r...
Good quality product,Overall phone is good. But camera quality is not that much good it's like decent camera. If you want to buy a camera centric phone is not for you. And coming to the screen its not Amoled display but quality of screen is very good. I use this phone past 45 days and it the best phone under 20000. You can blindly believe me and purchase this phone if you want to purchase.
Wonderful,mobile is very good it is worth the money camera is also very good May not play the game otherwise its processor is a plus point for me
Nice product,It's the best phone i have ever purchased. I like this product very much the battery backup is so amazing . And it is the gaming beast best phone for gaming under this range. But Charging speed is little bit slow but no problem.
Super!,"Good phone. Best performance we can get for this price. In number camera is bad. But the ISP of SD860 gives better output and natural colours. The photos can't be zoomed as 64/108 MP but the photo we get have enough colour and details. This phone has the best ips lcd screen I have ever used, without comparing to amoled It has good colours and the refresh rate works smooth not like other smart phone in this price range. Many people say that MIUI is tough UI, full of bugs and glitches. But t..."
Best in the market!,It's awesome.. I really loved it... Macro camera is so awesome... But I was not much happy with the normal camera of 48mp...but overall other performance.. Such as battery.. Gaming.. Calling nd what's else all its awesome... I really loved it very much
Very Good,If you play a lot of games then you can't get a better phone then this it works smoothly and the camera is pretty good too the only thing I don't like is that people say it overheats but it doesn't the highest it goes is 52-53°c which is stable but the temperature rises really quickly the liquid cooling is good though it decrease it's temperature under 2-3 minutes the biggest problem I think it has is that the back vibrates a lot whenever you are playing songs at high volume other than that t...
Good quality product,Best mobile phone under 20k. Paradise for gamers. Camera is of decent quality. But perfomance is mind blowing.. You can opt this beast under budget
Really Nice,POCO X3 Pro is really a good device and value for money. This device performance is awesome software wise. Camera quality is also nice.Overall I would say someone will not regret after buying this device.Flipkart is offering EMI on Debit card for payment which is really good. But the old phone exchange system is not good because flipkart doesn't take the phone and provide discount as they promise. It happened with me that i have to pay the amount at the time of collecting my new phone.
Good choice,"A review with 1 month of usage.,I have upgraded from poco f1 with comparison that this x3 pro has bad Cameras, very lag UI, slow, no miui phone and message application.The gaming performance is only good and seems same to 845 processor.The battery backup is very good coming to its cons.It doesn't seems a great update to poco f1.Its very huge and takes a lot of time to get used to it, i haven't yet.To me the poco f1 is a champ compared to this."
Worth every penny,"Pros...Phenomenal performanceBig 120Hz displayLong-lasting batteryCons....Big & bulkyNo 5GAverage cameraThe Poco X3 Pro is for Android gamers or power users on a budget, with near-flagship processing power in one of the cheapest phones on the market.

Super!,One of the best Android phones to use giving you complete value for money along with an unbeatable experience as an overall device. Well done POCO again!
Pretty good,After 1 week of usage. Performance wise its a awesome phone under 19 K. Camera quality is average. Battery backup is good. Processor is pretty awesome. Little bit heavy while using 1 hand. Overall a good phone.
Super!,Nice product 😍😍😍🤩I liked it and fastest delivery. Value for money.Best performance with great battery backup. Outstanding picture quality.  I will suggest this for everyone 🥰😍🤩
Wonderful,"I am writing the review after watching the mobile with concern for 2 days . The battery is good . Though it was draining for the high quality camera, I have turned it into standard. Picture quality is good and lovable. Display is good . The drawback to me is that it is bulky in size and heavy to keep for hours in hand. Must buy if you want a smooth with good processor and camera and the battery ... Under 20k it is best to buy . It gives a decent look overall it is my first mobile as I bought..."
Terrific,(1)  Gamer's pov -----------      This is the best f*ucking phone for u if u wanna play heavy games like Bgmi Genshin impact etc under the price tag of 20k inr. I have played Bgmi continuously for hours and it ran super smooth maintaining about 58-60 fps constantly in ace tier classics. In costoms there was a little framedrop but I think that's not a problem.

Excellent,"The Poco X3 Pro has set yet another benchmark in the mid-range segment with its class-leading performance. The phone offers lag-free performance, which is what gaming aficionados mostly prefer. The vibrant stereo speakers and the high-refresh-rate display just adds to that fluid experience. But while the phone yields a power-packed performance, the cost-cutting factor is clearly visible in the display and camera segment. If you are looking for a complete package, then Poco X3 Pro's dull displ..."
Simply awesome,Performance is beast as expectedCamera is decent in daylight conditions ( lots of Features ) Battery life is amazing Display is nice ( can't compare with amoled) still it's nice and 120 hz is pretty awesome and 240 hz touch sampling rate is amazingAudio quality is mesmerizing due to stereo speakersBut it vibrates when played loud. Charging speed is also good 0 to 100 in approx 80 mins No one waits the battery to go to 0 So within 1 hour it goes from 20 to 100..Don't worry about ...
Terrific purchase,Very nice phone at this price .. totally impressive 😍 taken picture from this camera.. you can see and guess yourself..I would like to recommend all to buy this phone.. specially for gaming performance 🔥🔥
Pretty good,"It's been more than 15 days I'm using this new poco X3 pro there is no issues it's well efficient with great value of money... If you're looking for a gaming phone it's totally good cause I used to play pubg, call of duty & minecraft and still find no issues.. camera is more than sufficient with some new features.. it has 860 Snapdragon so the processor is too good i don't think you will find this much but it has LCD screen so I don't go for dark modes can cause heating issues still I didn't ..."
Value-for-money,"I have been using this device for 10 days check my detailed review below:Pros: Performance it's the best you can get, Camera: Main camera is a decent one takes good crisp shot on day light but the selfi camera struggles a lot in indoor and low light conditions.Battery: It will last a day in heavy usageCharging speed: It was fast but not as fast as they advertised it will take more than an hour to fully charge around 80 min.Display: It's a pretty good panel excellent in indoor and usable ..."
Waste of money!,Over all mobile is good but some problem is there1) google diler is not good . And not showing block calls. And we can't do call recording on google diler. And it's a very big problem. 2) massaging app is not good. It's not showing block msg.Xiaomi should work on this very seriously. 3) proximity sensor not working properly.
Great product,"During charging gets little heat. But, a good phone in a decent price. Charging us very fast. Charge remains a full day if you are not a heavy gamer. Camera in daylight is excellent but in low light needs more improvement. Although we should not expect everything in such low price. Over all I am happy having this phone. No regret."
Pretty good,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. Performance is top notch, no lag nothing of whatsoever. Battery is more than decent.. Doesn't heat much.. Battery backup is quiet impressive even with 120Hzs.Camera is decent.. Charging speed is excellentOverall the device is worth every penny."
Really Nice,"I just love to play pubg, that's why i take this one, it's quite good while playing pubg, camera quality not meet my expectations. But i like this phone, phone heats easily while playing but battery charging is fast. Overall i like this phone."

Simply awesome,"Great performance as expected, if one is used to IPS LCD then it's great overall. Also as for MIUI, one can always customise and use accordingly. Great product overall"
Excellent,"Reached 1 day early! Such a value for money device. A very big and beautiful display sporting super quick and responsive 120 hz refresh rate. Battery is big but drops quickly in heavy usage. Camera is not too good but not too bad. Overall a performance packed device and such a steal for this much less money. If your a gamer, just go for it."
Worth every penny,"I am writing this review after 10 days of use and also I am not a heavy user or gamer. My observations are 1. Good performance and speed of response when we open or close an app (may be due to the high performance processor)2. Good display (for a normal user, LCD FHD is more than enough)3. Good sound (the backside panel vibrates along with speaker and we can feel it, if we hold mobile on hand, but that is not a problem)4. The camera is good and not excellent5. The UI is same as the UI of..."

Terrific purchase,"Amazing phone! Bought it a month ago so I would like to mention some pros n cons in my povCONS1.

Awesome,Best gaming phoneIt gives better performance than rog 3I tried rog 3 six months and i will recommend you all to buyPoco x3 pro
Good,"The backcover of the phone is vibrating when media and music you play. The UI is not very good, when you want to move any app to home screen, the app not move properly only it copied to your home screen and the result is you see two app in home and app screen, unnecessarily the app occupied your  screen in two places.But the order has been delivered within 24 hour amazingly, thank you flipkart for your fastest delivery."
Just okay,Display is very nice and 120hz is smooth and sharp .battery is good for one day usage.processor is very beast .but camera is average .overall review is good for gamers .....to is too heavy
Fair,860 sd work great Camara is normalDisplay ips not good compare redmi 8 proBack are vibration📳📳 so much when music is loud.

Slightly disappointed,Friends if you are selfie lover pl dont buy this model. Front camera is not good. It is not 20 mp. Very poor performance of front camera and it is without flash. Battery is good who using mobile for normal use. I am not gamer so can't comment on this point. Back camera is also ok ok. I am having note 5 pro and I found note 5 pro camera was much better than poco x3. Rest function are much similar to old model.

Just wow!,Superb phone Camera quality is good... Very nice phone Game best wala phone And most powerful phone Snapdragon 860 g most powerful Game turbo unbelievable👍👍👍
Best in the market!,"Excellent performance, Excellent stereo sound experience,  Excellent smartphone for gaming and hard user's . Total poisa usul ...Cons.IPS display not Super Amoled .Just one problem and if you considered it then you got a BEST smartphone with SD-860 processor"
Hated it!,"DON'T BUY THIS DEVICE!! I can explain why... I bought this device 1 year ago and I was satisfied with the performance till few weeks back and then comes the software update 12.5.6.I dont even know what happened with the device ; it became dead without any single external damage.And now all my data are gone and when I approached Service centre, they says that replacement of this device with Mi Note 10 pro is not possible as the warrenty expired. But the fault is not on my side; its on the comp..."
Good choice,Its nice phone display was awsome dont thing about ips vs amoled display I think better is ips display camera is ok battery is good performance is super And don't think about phone is weight this is normal weight
Mind-blowing purchase,"Review is as simple as that, if you want a performance based phone like GAMING and LONG TERM use, just GO for it.CAMERA quality is above AVERAGE and below GOOD.BATTERY and CHARGING is GOOD.Display is at its best in IPS display range. (Butter smooth 120hz)Beareble heating and cooling technology works COOL."
Wonderful,I will get to the point....phone maintains good fps but heats up a lot without proper Air conditioning...camera is below average to be honest but does take good low-light photos...and there is some kind of slow internet issue on a cellular network...I have checked everything aspect of the problem and I have came ro the conclusion that its a software issue... honestly this phone would be much better on a stock android operating system!
Simply awesome,1. Good and bright display 2. Camera is good but inLow-light performance Is not Good3. Awesome performance          Best for gaming
Fair,"Hardware of the phone is very reasonable for the price. However, like all Xiaomi phones in the recent days, the UX (user experience) is bad compared to the good old days during 2014-2017 when there was less to no bloatware or ads in the UI. If the UX and UI isn't a priority for yourself, this is one of the well made phones, especially with the IR sensor which I find  ery useful on travels or even at home to handle remote operated devices."
Excellent,Very good product and great service filpkart great product in tha and great service
Terrific,"Good mobile with good battery life. Camera is also good. After a few updates, 4g+ is also seen. MI software is the most horrible on a 5/5 hardware, hoping it will improve over time, it keeps killing apps to save battery even after turning OFF the battery optimization. Full charge within an hour. Call quality is very good and speaker quality and sound volume is very good, fills a room. Value for money, highly recommended buy."
Super!,Phone's designed is  super-duper and also have a excellent processor value of money it is no more heavy  but it's inhand weight not feel heavy ...if you are gamer go for this device it's performance is like heavy drive 😂🤍 most powerful processor in this pricerange go for it ...

Classy product,"Pros:1. Equipped with SD 860 flagship level processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. Hence device is fast enough with enough storage.2. Premium 6.67"" LCD display. Black is deeper than cheap AMOLED displays.3. Stereo speakers.4. 33W fast charger included.5. Camera is good enough. Can deliver crisp and clear photos in moderate to good lighting conditions.Cons: Still I didn't find any con. But one thing is to mention.

Excellent,"In my opinion this is the best smartphone you can get under 20k.Pros.1. very useable and good camera.2. Very nice 120htz display if your last phone also had LCD, but if it wasOLED than i dont know what will it feel like but i think its the best lcd display.3. Very good battery, which lasted me on heavy usage for like 7 hours on full charge, but if you dont use so much phone in a day then you dont have to charge it for 3 daya i think.4. For performance you just need the name of the proc..."
Terrific,It's very big in size than my initial expectations and would have preferred better battery life than fast charging but other than that it's truly a value for money phone. Everything is perfect about this phone compared to price. Switching from poco f1 it's to bring to notice of you all when you record a call the other person will get a beep saying that your call is recorded which doesn't used to happen in my previous phone. Else best phone for its price
Best in the market!,this product is very good and giving the best gaming performance.poco x3 pro is the best product for value of  money
Delightful,I love this Mobil and it's battery is very nice and it's camera is not okk but it's okk while in day time it's display is not okk in out side but inside its best
Delightful,Writing review after 14 days of hardcore UseageCamera is too darkDisplay is good and smoothIf we put display on 120hz refresh rate then battery gets drained quickly than 60 Lagging in genshin impact gameBut pubg runs very smooth Best phone for gamers not so for person who like photography
Perfect product!,Very nice phone under 19 k . Gaming performance is awesome . Battery backup is okk But overall best phone
Terrific purchase,Beast device worth the price does heat up at times but a worth 8 series Snapdragon in this price range. camera average but is a gaming monster and good battery life with a 33w charger fast charging with Gorilla glass 6 protection and also a headphone jack. all this for 19k and offers. im CYKD. Now this is a FLAGSHIP OVERKILL.
Perfect product!,"It's super cool I'm loving it charging is super fast,  big display,  loud sound, good camera ( if you are reading this then stream fearless TV) LOL"
Does the job,"This mobile look very good but, Needs a big update just like 3-5gb like. Audio quality during call is too much worst. Game booster doesn't have call or notifications blocking system and background call option is not available during game. Screen recorder doesn't record system sounds. Chrome browser doesn't work properly in this phone, if you exit browser download will be stop. Doesn't have any off display gesture just like music change, double tap to screen wake-up and many more gesture."
Wonderful,"Good phone, value for money , usd it for one week and great performance with 120hz smooth refresh rate , I use it roughly like all time, for me battery will come around for 12 hours , not bad if u use it smoothly with less usage you will get battery back up for 1 day , camera is ok with 48mp I liked the phone for this price range it will be the best phone"
Just wow!,For me the most important thing is processor... And you know it can run bgmi in smooth extreme balanced extreme hd extreme hdr extreme ultra hd ultra...

Useless product,"Not worthy and Not so good as F1Looks bulky & heavy. Display is very dull. In sunlight, U will struggle alot to see the screen on highest brghtness too. If compared with other same panel devices, this device display is worst. Battery is okay. Realme camera under 10k is far better than this Poco X3 Pro.

Worst experience ever!,Don't buy this phone my mob got suddenly dead after 1 year for no reason! And many people having same issueDont or you will loose your money
Very Good,Hii you know poco x3 pro is a gamaing phone . This is a value for money .but this phone in a one problem is a very heating  . When I Play games this phone is a very heating . please fix this problem.thank you
Unsatisfactory,"It's not a gaming phone when you game play It's hang automatically fire , move , msg tab opne and close etc.. like ghost playing your phone you can't control your phone whenever it's happen.Battery backup is good but phone is over heated when you charged or playing games or anything you do.Sound quality is good but when you play music or anything else on full volume it's vibrate 📳 your phone.Camera is good not best.Performance is very poor.So don't buy this phone."
Did not meet expectations,A little bit of storage moves up phone start laging in bgmi or pubg or in normal use also. And file manager take very long time to process files and to desplay them. Display after 5 monthes starts giving a little problem. During playing games when we want to rotate screen upside down it did not work. Camera is not so outsatanding but like a normal 10k phone like camera. Overall performance is okay but not so good due to many bugs in phone. Maybe my review not desplay to everyone but who ever ...

Fabulous!,"The camera is only average, but the battery life is phenomenal but the highlight of this phone is it's display this is the best lcd panel I've seen on a phone but the value for money aspect when compared to the top spec poco x3 is questionable but as this phone provides unmatched raw performance in this segment it's a great deal just note that this phones primarily excels at gaming and not photography also refrain from doing the 12.5 miui update as the phone heats up quicker compared to how u..."

Terrific,"Never buy this phone .... Please save your money ,..i used 5 months and the phone is dead 😔 don't buy this poco X3 pro ..."
Brilliant,If you are trying to buy a camera phone then just go to redmi note ten pro. If you are buying for performance then nothing in the 25000 range beats this phone. It's processor is top notch and has a decent camera + nice audio quality.. Would definitely recommend
Must buy!,Best phone. Go for it if u want a phone for high performance. Not upto mark for photos but great for me as I don't take too many pics. Vibrates when speaker is in use which is a bit irritating. Best for gaming.
Perfect product!,As expected the phone was phenomenal. 120hz display is very smooth no lag battery backup and charge time is very very good. Lasts a long time and charges up in no time thanks to the 33w inbox charger. The only downside is the camera not too good but not too bad. Decent photos and video quality. The best part is the SD860 processor which is the main selling point of this device. Very smooth and lag free experience while gaming graphic settings at highest with no lag or framedrop. All in all go...

Decent product,"You are looking for this phone only for its processor and few other perks .Phone works well as a mid tier gamer's phone, while camera performance is remarkable(not great) in comparison to its other competitors in the segment .This is not a all rounder for average user but   a promising device for long run .(:Please note:)*Buy 8 GB version for future readiness.And get a hard case along with a rear camera glass protection"
Super!,The processor is just amazing Especially if you are playing games there is  literally no lag.Camera i would rate 4/5Battery performance is also excellent and it comes with a  33W fast charger which is an advantage

Value-for-money,Outstanding performance...value for money..Camera quality is cheap not an good camera..gaming is outstanding performance..I loved it it proves the processer power ...Then ..if we play pubg have some heating issues ..that irritating me .and the vibration mode off setings is not available..Performance wise it's the better phone under 20 k
Worth the money,1 star I cut for camera and battery because my cousin has poco X3 camera and battery is much better than poco X3 pro but I will suggest you Poco X3 pro because camera and battery both are more then sufficient then my need and it is not to big it size is equal to redmi note 9 pro and not to heavy my old phone is very light and small but I am More comfortable with Poco X3 pro if you have a budget of 20000 and you want performance this is the best I think I din't like one think  will using speak...
Must buy!,"120hz display is awesome, 120 hz can be downgraded in settings to increase battery backup. Normal heating occurs while gaming for a considerable amount of time. Dual stereo speakers gives good feeling. The back panel of the phone vibrates with sound makes us more involved to music that the vibration we could feel on hands. Best part is the processor. High end processor coming with this model makes it very responsive. No lagging. Performance wise cool and dynamic. Camera department is very goo..."
Terrific,This is one of the best smart phone for gaming under 20k.I really like this phone by its all sides. This is worthy buying . Best performance and it's 120hz reality flow display with 240hz touch sampling can feel to use like a costly product that we use. Honestly I prefer to buy this phone if u really wants performance and normal camera users.
Worthless,Avoid this device at all costs. Its components are really cheap and the proof for it is my motherboard died twice and I'm still yet to get a response from the service centre of either poco or Flipkart.I just wish I never bought this garbage.please avoid at all costs before you regret later.
Nice product,"Everything's packed well, brilliant performance, good battery, fast charging, excellent 120Hz refresh rate, and totally worth for the money. The Era of Poco F1 is back but with one disadvantage. The camera is below average and the 48MP tag, and the multiple cameras are a total waste.. Buy without a doubt, if you want performance and the battery run!"
Wonderful,"Amazing phone at this price range.Indeed a flagship killer. Excellent display. Superfast performance. A good camera.There's a little heating issue on progress prolonged usage. Battery drains a bit faster due to 120hz refresh rateHowever, an excellent performer and value for money."
Fabulous!,Hey guys I got it today and I just felt it was so good why people are expecting a pro cameras in a mid range phone actually I does pretty well in auto mode and excellent in pro mode and all other things was good not to complain about but the only concern for me is I don't like miui coz before this I was using stock android that was soo cool than this but other wise an extraordinary phone under 20 k and I don't think 8gig version is useful for day to day use
Fabulous!,i am using this 8 days.. its performance is excellent.. i love its performance but battery and camera is not good as i am expected.. battery drain is too fast... not perform like 5000 mah ..  charging speed not fast like poco x3.. overall you can buy  this if you compromise camera and battery ..
Brilliant,"Used 3 days as of now....( Previous 2 phone used-  Asus Zenfone max pro M1 replaced later with Poco X2 )Now upgraded to Poco X3ProImpressions - Chipset performance for Pubg is really awesome, you can play in graphics 'UltraHD' mode with frame rate 'ultra', its genuinely butter smooth display, awedome sound and flawless experience ...... It is really awesome.Battery consumption 10% every hour for Active display with surfing or other things. Charging time 15% - 100%  = 70-75 minutes...."
Great product,"I have recently purchasd this smattphone from flipkart. The quality is very good, it look and feel very premium in hand. After using this for a week now I can say that it is best value for money. Pros :-120 Hz Super Smooth DisplayHigh Performing Processor for GamingVery good battery lifeCons :-Camera is averagePhone feels little bulkierThanks to flipkart for super quick delivery of this product at this difficult time. I am very satisfied with service and offers provided by flipkart..."
Highly recommended,This is very much awesome phone display is very very very good and performance is on the top its very smooth for gaming and camera is not that bad camera is also nice i donot face any problem in camera In the end its very good phone under 30000 rs its fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and battery is awesome its charger is also very much fast
Perfect product!,Latest features packed phone with snapdragon the best. Handy mobile. Awesome cameras especially natural selfie cam which i never expected as it is a gaming oriented mobile. But really a perfect all rounder🔥
Does the job,"Pros : super fast performance. 60fps stable in pubg mobileAbove average cameraFast chargingHandles all task and video editing with easeCons : speaker causes back plastic panel to vibrateSlightly heats up during gaming, but not an issue.Theres an issue with touch where random touch gets registered suddenly. Ram gets filled up fastVerdict : best gaming phone under 20k."
Value-for-money,If you are going to buy a good phone with decent camera and good battery life with a flagship level performance then go for it. Back panel vibrates while playing music in high volume. It also have screen flicker problem at low brightness. Gaming is awesome in this device. You will get max settings and no lags in all games except some. App installation time surprise me like It can install a 30MB app in 5 -15 sec. But I think miui 12 is too much heavy that's why it can not give the max...
Awesome,"Best 💯value for money phone in this price bracket..... Performance wise there are no compilation out there.... This phone is for performance lover only, battery backup, camera, build quality are decent... Highly recommend form my site.... 👍🔥"
Worst experience ever!,Very very worst phone which i am using before.. 1st Or  2nd sim automatically not dedicated many times. Very irritating for us. Even in calls automatically disconnected. Not worth for money. I am very disappointed. I am interested to upgrade some other user friendly phone in available in market. My review is -1.
Brilliant,Excellent speedy phone. Battery back up is also good camera quality good. overall a good phn
Must buy!,Performance on top. Good display 120hz refrresh rate.Attractive Design .big battery charging speed is fast.Cameras quite good front camera is good for selfies. Loud speakers you love them. For this prize with this processor this the best package
Wonderful,"As expected Flipkart delivered the phone fast and safe. Phone is superb. Brilliant screen, awesome battery performance, and no lag at all in any condition. Overall, the phone is the best option in this price range."
Just wow!,Absolutely a stunning performance but it heats up a lot if u r under fan it's ok charging speed is that great I u r guy like me who don't think about camera it is absolutely for u it's performance beast at this price
Pretty good,"It is the best performance mode phone under 20k as said by poco & yes it is...Good battery lifeAwesome display with 120hz refresh rateCamera quality is decentBeast in gaming. Can play all high end graphic games without any problems & lags& It is excellent phone for all the PUBG playersFast fingerprint scannerYes, it has High Res.Audio also, you can experience it while playing games & other stuffsAlso it has nice grip on sides"
Worth every penny,At the launching time gaming in this phone was unmatchable but after some update gaming and performance is average
Classy product,Very nice phone. It's totally value for money. It's the best phone under 20k rupee. It's performance is awesome. It's camera isn't that good but i don't care anyway. I bought it for gaming and it's doing very good in that area. It does heat a lot though. It's battery is...good? I feel like it's not a 5000 but instead a 4000 mah battery. But it charges fast so it's not a big problem. So overall i would give it a 9.5 out of 10.
Just wow!,"This is my review after using it for 1 week and I would say it is a flagship experience. I switched from oneplus 7T to this and never felt downgraded. Actually the battery in this is very good and it lasts a day easily even with heavy usage. I found this a little heavy with case and so using it without any case. I would say if your budget is around 20k and you need a overall phone with best processor, go for it."
Terrific,"Best budget smart phone gaming + also all around camare and other features superb , just one minuse point is this is very havy feel after long and big feel in your hand other wise i love it 💖"
Wonderful,"It is a very good device to cover all the aspects of our daily uses, except the camera part, though x3 got a decent camera set up, but it could have been better, the front camera take good selfies, overall it is a value for money device."
Highly recommended,Besides the worthy Mobile I would also like to mention that  the delivery boy was extremely humble n patient. His dedication n hardworking was clearly visible as he tried thrice to deliver the product hassle free.
Delightful,"If you want a best performance smartphone under 20000 this is the phone you have been looking for but it's not 5g and does not have amoled display but has 120 hertz refresh rate which works excellent and QS860 processor is just insane. But MIUI , I don't like it much and it also has quiet some software issues."
Wonderful,"Very good for heavy task, camera is good but not great, battery is more than enough 8 out of 10"
Awesome,"If you only want a good processor in reasonable price then go for it, if you want other features like camera, user interface, looks, light weight, fast charge etc. then search other options"
Highly recommended,"This is the best one u can get under 20k. If u r a gamer, u have to go for this. Best one in this price range. Camera is okaish. Battery is very good. Cools fast. Display is good. U can fave 1,2 minor problems. But that's not gonna make u sad Or angry. This is the budget gaming beast. Thank you poco for this beast. Love for Flipkart is infinity."
Does the job,This Phone is good for normal use but for gaming it's not that good..... although it has very much good processor with 860 Snapdragon and good battery capacity....but the Phone is getting heat up for using gaming short period
Simply awesome,This mobile is good for this value you will satisfied battery performance is awesome fast charging make our time saving and more likely display is very good for playing games watching videos its really good in performance. Its equal to oneplus 7t like this mobile we can get better performance in android while comparing to iphone is not ok in performance but battery its ok but while comparing to other android phones its really awesome to use blast fast mobile enjoy it for many purposes
Mind-blowing purchase,Have been using it from past 1 month and i must say that this phone has best performance in the segment and after  an update of miui 12.0.5 its camera quality has been improved and battery too In short this is the snappiest phone u can get under 20kAnd its a genuine post Yes carrier aggregation or 4g+ it support but only 2300 band and overall package is good u can go for it peace.
Nice product,"This is my honest review for Pocox3 pro As we know this device is specially made for gamers others things are not very good at this price rangeGaming is very good I smoothly play pubg for hours on high settings, It works very well.

Great product,Thank you so much for your fast delivery.Also thank to the delivery guy as well
Good choice,"After a month use i am writing this review. Before this I was using POCO X3, which was one of the worst mobile I have ever used. It was hanging a lot. But then I understood the difference is in Processor. This mobile has got much better processor. I am more comfortable after using this pro version. No hanging, no slowing down, no heating problems etc.. The only issue I am seeing in this is Software, somewhere the MIUI built for particularly both POCO X3 & X3 Pro is not upto the mark & not..."
Highly recommended,"Nice choice of device in this price range.At starting it had a screen defect in my case but it got resolved once I restarted the device.I feel like the battery drains faster.Camera is good, better than all devices in this range.Performance is top notch, day to day activities are smooth and gaming is also good in this device.This device has a heating issue while gaming and it also gets warmer while doing day to day activities.Overall this device is a good choice in this price range."
Awesome,Well if you are looking for a phone under 20000 i would personally tell you its poco x3 pro. Just loved it their perfomans  is like one plus nord with snap dragon 860 its just amazing. If you are a pubg or a pes player take this phone its amazing. Just can't describe this phone just awsome.....
Awesome,"Best gaming phone under 20k. It has lcd display which is good but amoled is great, if you compromise with camera and display as we are getting amoled and best camera under 20k in some other mobiles, this is a best option for you. Best performance mobile under 20k."
Terrific purchase,"Have this phone being used by my younger cousin  and I have also been using it for more than a year now and it is very smooth and  be it emails , games no lag, surfing, call clarity is good"
Terrific,"Poco x3 pro is just perfect for this price range. It's processor, speed, display, battery all the excellent. Don't blame camera quality... Camera is good with good clarity for this price range. If you prefer camera just go for some other mobile. Liked the product 😀"
Fabulous!,It is absolute good product as a PUBG gaming. It has good proccesure sd 860 and it refresh rate 60 and 100
Highly recommended,As usual performance is beast 😍😍 fully disaster 😍😍 fully killer soc Snapdragon 860/855+😍😍😍😍 performance like 30k phone or higher And my unit performance is stable fully stable not fluctuating a little bit. And my unit camera is also good but front camera is awesome 😍😍Battery good Screen op smoothBut my opinion if anyone have  Budget go for 8g version Is featured proof (my 6gb )
Terrific,"There could not be a better phone in this price range. After exchange and discounts ,I got it for 12.5k .There is only one con and that's the camera but since I use DSLR most of the time, m happy with it. I wud give the camera 3/5.The display is surprisingly smooth considering it's an ips lcd display. The 120hz refresh rate is the cherry on the cake.Coming to performance ,it's a beast. Everything works so fast that you will love it..good job Poco. Very happy with the phone."
Wonderful,Best phone for normal and heavy users.... It do not have amoled display but It feel better than amoled🥰 if you are looking for gaming phone or the phone for 5years go for it... I'm sure you'll love it ❤
Just wow!,I will like to say that this is the best phone in the this amount of money you pay it has a wonderful processing camera is also good the only thing which I can say a can be improved in this phone is about his its weight.It's made in India value for money e grade processing mind blowing

Neither did I drop my phone (not in water, not on the ground) nor mischarge nor made it work heavily continuously. I didn't even play any heavy games yet.

Camera got all sorts of editing tools and vlog mode. Battery lasts for two days. The only negative I found is the back panel vibrates when using speakers. Probably because of the cooling plates within. Better than any phone in this price segment. A flagship killer of flagship killers."

Utterly Disappointed,Ghost touch issue

Simply awesome,"Everything in this phone is good enough for under 20k price range. Only one issue I found that, in lowest brightness display light is fluctuating. I replaced it, but problem remains same in new one. It should not happened..."
Brilliant,Camera is not bad as all are saying. Ok for casual photography. Performance is the best not even any phone upto 25000 can match the performance. Battery and charging speed  is  ok.  Display is really good if you don't need amoled. App open close speed is really fast. But little heavy and thick.
Good,If you don't need performance then go for others device.... It's only for performance and power💪..
Best in the market!,"120HZ is only Supported over UI. COD-m, PUBG-M and other battle-royale are still on 60fps(Even after applying patch for 90fps). Everything of this Phone is perfect. Just waiting for perfect G-CAM.Just Unbeatable."

Nice product,I bought this phone a few days ago...and this has an overall good performanceThe camera is averageIt has heating issue (not so much)Good gaming performance for pubgBattery capacity is good ..and its charging is also fastDisplay is also goodOverall..its one of the best phones in this price range⚡
Absolute rubbish!,At this price point camera is not good .Performance of the device is good but not amazing. Pubg lacks even in hdr settings. Screen freezes for a second in game. Speakers are good. phones heats up even in low tasking or in playing music only. Don't buy by watching videos of tech youtuber.they do paid reviews I have realized from this device.
Mind-blowing purchase,Beast in the segment.. Battery🔋 Backup is amazing.. Processor is awesome.. Camera 📷 is ok.. 120Hz is just lit.. Value for money.. just go for it over realme 8 series and Mi Note 10 series.. Way better than those..
Terrific,Great phone
Worth every penny,Very good delivery and the phone is absolutely brilliant.....
Awesome,Super phone
Did not meet expectations,This device dies in 8 months and it cannot be replaced all manufacture of this phone is over never buy this phone this phone is faulty everyone’s poco x3 pro is blacking out never buy this product
Don't waste your money,Worst device ever got dead in only 7 months and now they are offering me redmi note 10 pro Don't buy this or any Xiaomi redmi or poco device
Did not meet expectations,"Don't buy, It's is dead after 5months automatically. My phone is completely dead after 5months. Don't buy. If you want to take a risk, please go ahead."
Super!,Nice
Highly recommended,Osm ph gaming best ph under 20000
Simply awesome,Poco X3 Pro is crazy fast...I didn't used any 800 series SOC before I think all the consumer going to benefits with this. To be honest Poco X3 is a flagship phone under 20k. There's only one con; that is degrade camera compared to Poco X3...

Good quality product,Beast phone under 20k 1) People who are saying pubg is lagging make sure before opening the game switch screen refresh rate down to 60hz as game booster tries to push to 120 hz and in game setting tries to down to 60 this causes screen Jitter and lag.2) camera is average as it's a gaming phone3) some are saying chrome is not working at 120hz it's app issue which can be easily  resolve by typing chrome.// flags (please seach on internet) and again search  android surface make it disable3) ...

Wonderful,"The best phone within the budget i have used for 10 days no issue yet sometimes little bit heating issue if your using roughly, but the performance is best quality. I was thinking to return again I decided it's good going"
Wonderful,Powerful performance by Snapdragon 860. Good Battery life. Good camera quality.
Hated it!,Worst phone ever!...multiple touch(ghost-touch) issues will come within 2 months...screen flickering and touch problem will always comes..cheap build quality..I recommend not to buy poco x3 pro

Great product,"Worth full of each penny. Used for 2 months.. best smartphone in this segment even if you compare with other devices which is way more costlier than this . Forget about 5G , it will not come to India anytime soon. Probably in time you'll get another new device when the 5G will through all over India.

Mind-blowing purchase,Amazing camera quality and gaming performance
Fabulous!,Just got it yesterday. The performance is top notch under 20k no doubt about that. But camera is average. And also the display is quite good. I have seen many people talking about having touch issues or screen flikering while playing games but until now haven't seen anything like that. So if you want performance based phone then don't think just buy this.
Best in the market!,Nice product
Wonderful,Too good for the price range...jst loved it and im writing this after using for a week..jst go for it..its a beast..the camera aint that bad like people say..its above average and all in all hats off..

Terrific purchase,Its simply awesome... And you can get it with only 19k... Then again it has a ips dim display .. can make you worry in the sunlight... Now if you wanna go for the performance then its simply incomparable in the current sceniario. No w heavy game are nothing to worry my friend...But also it you want a good Camera phone ... Plzz pass by... it's not for you... But Camera of the phone will not let you down ..However 48mp camera with so much manual features makes this a manual camera beast ... B...
Must buy!,Overall a great value for money phone.. I had to choose between clean stock Android.. g60 vs X3 pro power punch of SD860.. finally I settled for SD860..coz poco gives you option to block unnecessary adds... This is my second poco.. first was poco F1 purchased in first ever sale in 2018 with SS 845.. Since then for me.. it's all about the power.. Rest everything falls in place..Other plus for me in poco X3 pro :-1. Gorilla glass 62. 5160 mAh bty3. 33w fast charging4. Ufs 3.1 storage5. ...
Highly recommended,"Battery drain is high in miui but with custom ROM it was awesome and camera is good  enough with lots of features,performance is beast heating more while playing pubg 90 fps and HDR  60fps"

Very Good,"I have been using a POCO F1 prior to thus, and thats the reason for me to have faith and go ahead with X3 PRO. After around 3 months, there are 2 things:1. Vibration among the back panel while playing anything on speaker. 2. I did notice few times the phone getting hanged while using Instagram. Not sure, if that's phone issue or insta's. Other than the above one's I didn't find any other major issues. It's a brilliant value for money, period."
Excellent,I really loved them real cam quality 🥺❤ fast charger and battery life is unbelievable. I'm not a rough user. Not a gamer and I don't know anything about that. If you are looking for a good cam and battery backup then go for poco x3 pro
Good choice,Pros:1. Unmatched performance. It's really fast.2. Phone handle's games and daily task with ease. 3. Display is good. You will never regret about the display.Cons:1. Definitely phone feels bit heavy. Though you may get used to it.2. Once you play songs or watch video. You can feel the vibration on the back side of the phone. Sometimes it's annoying.3. Camera is average. Does decent job.You can buy this phone if you are looking for snappy performance.
Wonderful,"I just want to say one thing about this phone, if your budget is 19k-20k. You can buy this phone without any doubt. I'm saying this because I have used pocoF1 and this phone is next version of pocoF1. I have reviewed this after one mont of use.*best thing is Processor."
Fabulous!,"Used this phone for 2 months, great experience in terms of performance, i really hated the back of this phone, thus decided to use a carbon fiber skin, without case as this phone is already too bulky.PS: I am not a gaming person, got this phone because the flagship processors can easily last 3-4 years in comparison to mid range 7 series chipset"

Utterly Disappointed,"If you want to take this for Gaming I say don't buy it. There is lots of display issue, ghost touch, ghost volume up and down and too much heat produced. You use this device in place of popcorn machine"
Brilliant,"Battery back-up is not that much good. Need to charge twice in a day at least, if you Play pubg for 2hr minimum.Good thing is the fast charging.  It charges very quickly within 1hr. Rest.. camera is decent, above average. Front camera's sharpness is too high. Pubg gaming experience is really good . . Phone heats up but thats okay. It has liquid cooling system so cools down quickly as well. One more thing, back vibrates alot while Playing any music. Seems like back cover is not tightly attach..."

Wonderful,"Appears to be good. But then, I have been using Mi phones for quite some time, so am sure it will live up to its reputation. For all those, who rush to buy a glass protector for a new phone, be aware this one already has a plastic film that is so well applied, you wont know its there. Why waste it, you can put a new one after this one is all scratched. Anyways the phone has gorilla glass, so it does not really need a protector.For those who cant make up their mind about the colour, try the ..."

Value-for-money,"I have been using poco x3 pronfor 2 days so for no issue no lag and you can feel 120hz definetly if you are using mobile for games and heavy work you can buy and this phone is not for multimedia the camera is average, and selfie is below average, and dispaly is punchy and constrast            The main thing is battery is standby 7 hours of continue usage and  slight heat hapeens when charging, and make it worth your needs"
Delightful,"Good phone for the price. Not a camera centric phone I can say for sure now that I have used it for 2 weeks. POCO UI is a hit or a miss and personally speaking, it is a miss for me in the initial days and I think it will take me a while longer to get used to the UI. Only one grouch I have is regarding its weight - it weighs almost a quarter of a kilo when used with the transparent cover provided in the box."
Moderate,I don't understand that battery is not working well within 10 days of purchase. Even it is charging very slow like 2 hours of full charge inspite of 33 watt fast charger......Worst experience

Super duper smart mobile,Best gaming mobile
Terrific purchase,Sometimes COD mobile is Crashed. It is very crucial .
Not recommended at all,"I brought this phone 1st nov 2021 in just a month it's start screen flickering, ghost touch multi touch issue on display as well as heating issue while gaming like Pubg (BGMI). I think except processor they don't focus on the build quality of the phone. So I must say don't buy this phn just because of processor. Once I thought that too, but these device completely disappointed me."
Utterly Disappointed,"I urge and request each and every user who are planning to buy POCO X3 pro, please don't get trapped with the phone specs. The phone vibrates as if it is completely hollow from inside and you will get scared while taking calls and watching videos. The phone back panel vibrates like anything and while taking calls without loudspeaker then also the phone back panel vibrates. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I AM A VICTIM OF THIS PRODUCT SO PLEASE DON'T GET TRAPPED.."
Worst experience ever!,"Buy an poco x3 pro last month it's work perfect just two days and the, 1) problem is proximity sensor not working. 2) call connection is very very poor 3) half display not working perfect 4) back panel vib in soo much audio using time totally total waste for money need an first impression  is best impression ?????"
Decent product,Friend cam not better
Simply awesome,This phone is complete phone camera is better and gaming performance is excellent
Worth every penny,Best for gaming i love it
Value-for-money,A very good product at this price..But need to fix.. its vibration Otherwise 👍Display is LCD but... amazing.. to watch multimedia...A little bit heavier..but it's ok...Camera is ok.p
Useless product,"The phone has a very good processor and storage speed but the back is vibrating too much while playing songs/games due to ""stereo"" speakers. Battery backup is poor considering 5160mAh battery. It charges too slow while playing games. It took around 4 hours to charge when I was playing Brawl Stars. Facing some frame drops while scrolling feed on youtube."
Pretty good,Best mobile at this price
Terrific,NYC device value for money all features are fantastic
Terrific,Excellent camera performanceExtremely fast processorFast gaming Great value for money
Brilliant,If you want performance then go for it. If you are looking for better camera phone buy redmi note 10 pro max or moto g60. Overall this phones a beast.
Nice product,Performance is amazing but MIUI is quite a bit laggy. Hope it will improve with update.Average camera and display.Amazing sound quality.
Expected a better product,I'm playing a game but after some time phone stuck and return back the main screen. Battery🔋 backup also not good
Simply awesome,Poco poco poco what a product in this price range no other company gives you these features at this price.Highly recommended.Just close your eyes and go for it you absolutely don't regret after buying this mobile.
Best in the market!,Best value for money product loved it ❤️❤️
Fair,2 star less for MIUI BUGS. MIUI should be better that can handle all these specs
Nice,"Performance vise it's good but holding in the hand feels so much heavy,when other mobiles  making thin mobiles but poco producing mobiles like element weight and thinkness"
Fair,Auto call recording option is not there. Product wise it's good.
Not recommended at all,I am writing this review after 2 month. The worst phone I ever seen. what are disappointed me : camera performance not good.very low brightness display(don't have a sunlight mood😐).battery not performing like 5000mah abow.i have touch complaints when playing pubg and using normally.the side mounted finger print sencor not working some time. 120 hz refreshing rate is just a number I didn't ever seen a good performance.

Really Nice,Awesome
Excellent,"Decent camera, Ultimate performance.. Totally Good mobile"
Super!,Osm
Mind-blowing purchase,"The phone is best in performance, little disspapointment in camera department but it's not meant to be a photocentric phone. This phone is meant for performance and it delivers it perfectly. Speakers are a cherry on the top."

Pretty good,Front camera is very bad. Back camera is ok. Performance is good. Battery is just ok. Overall except front camera value for money

Wonderful,"Best phone in the budget. Unlike many reviews I have seen, I never faced severe heating issues. And I play a lot of pubg and brawlstars. Only faced mild heating issue in the beginning days but never in the later stages. And the speakers are very good."
Really Nice,Awesome Mobile I Love ItThanks Flipkart 👍
Did not meet expectations,Got dead after update
Bad quality,Screen touch get problem after using and camera is very low quality.... I dnt expected such a thing from flipkart i requipment all the user to purchase a mobile from the store.... Waste of money

Slightly disappointed,It's a bad item
Excellent,Overheating battery issue and camera issue
Mind-blowing purchase,Amazing😍 flipkart
Unsatisfactory,It's lagging while video recording. Only 3 months old device.
Terrific,Display is good for and ips but britness is too low i always use the device with 70% britness in indoor conditions
Pretty good,Just missing AMOLED display.Otherwise POCO X3 PRO is the best mobile under 20000
Very Good,"Camera is awesome, speed game verithanam."
Value-for-money,Very nice camera
For this price nothing can beat it.,For this price nothing can beat it. BGMI is smooth in extreme. No heating in my device even after 2 hours of playing. Hoping to get 90fps officially with BGMI. But anyways phone is good.
Fair,"Smooth performance. But motherboard dead after 7 months, very poor quality control.MIUI limits the full potential of this phone."
Highly recommended,Good

Value-for-money,Amazing phone but only issue when the phone vibrates while playing song due to dual speaker. Another issue is LCD screen which can be much better when compare to phones in similar ranger. Overall amazing product with snapdragon 860 processor which makes it a superb buy
Must buy!,Amazing product got this at 16950 Rs.
Value-for-money,"On an average it's a very good phone with super performance. But only uneasy thing I felt is the vibration below camera module when some thing is played via speaker.Rest is fantastic. Amoled is a obvious miss but performance do compensate. After booting updated to MIUI 12.5. Sound quality is excellent. It's Hi-Res certified. Also expected the battery drain to be more smooth. Anyhow, this is my one day review. Will update experience after a month."
Classy product,Perfect
Good choice,Best Phone under this price.!!
Perfect product!,Good product ...camera good ....i love it....

Useless product,After Some Days Use Mobile Performance Is Zero Lots Of Variations On Many Things.After Playing BGMI Gyroscope In Fail. Not Working Properly.
Terrible product,Don't buy
Terrible product,"Touch issues, after update it's gone for overheating, I can't even play the normal setting bgmi game because of touch issue on second day the phone was getting lag, don't take this phone"
Worthless,"Rear camera is very poor, I have used poco F1 and X2, their camera was too good. This camera seems like old mobiles 2mp camera."
Terrific purchase,"Writing this review after 1 week of use, Fast charging is good, but battery drains little bit faster, Processer is too good for multi tasking.. Camera is done the job, I'm not playing games that much, still I checked playing pubg there is no lag what so ever.. Great mobile at this range❤"
Slightly disappointed,I purchased Poco X3 Pro on April 29 2021 through flipkart but it started hanging and sometime showing touch complaint just after 1month.Sometimes we can't see any apps while scrolling up and even while video calling others can't hear what we are saying. Product model : M2102J20SIPoco X3 Graphite Black 8 GB/128 GB   I had send an email regarding the problems of the phone but there was not any enquiries regarding the complaint. I just got an email which said that there will be a call enquiry...
Simply awesome,"I purchased this phone for gaming but in first game so much lagTouch issue , touch late responseIn my view this mobile not enough for PUBG/BGMI my old realme 5 pro is better than this.."
Unsatisfactory,"Those who are overwhelmed by this phone performance kindly recheck.The UI is very buggy. MIUI is the worst optimizated OS. In game lags, de-sync issue, joy stick behaves wierd in BGMI (This proves the poor touch response) and many more.The hardware is super but the os provided with the phone is not matching up with the processor also the touch screen is really poor. Screen has some ghost touch issue."
Don't waste your money,Faulty peice
Useless product,POCO x3  pro is a very bad mobile after 1 month of purchase the android UI failed wifi didnt work hardwares failed even after rebooting and hard reset same message pops saying android ui not responding it promises everything in latest category but cheap finishing
Slightly disappointed,"I using poco x3 pro last 2months performance is vary low as per my acceptation.. And I m having some problem in display and touch screen.. I m traying to connect customer   service center not reachable,, so My suggest don't by this don't waste money.."

Good choice,"i faced only one issue that is its weight. Battery backup is perfect almost more than 1day of regular use. camera is perfect. This phone have heating issue if u play bgmi at ultra HDR. Smooth+extreme is best settings with 4 to 6 frame drop in bootcamp.As always, poco launcher have lots of bugs but manageable. I am using this phone with miui 12.0.5. and this update is perfect.

Terrific purchase,Nice
Useless product,"Very bad camera,battery backup,display,Apps not installing from shareit and file managerPerformance is nice Charging speed is good But over all it's not satisfying"
Bad quality,Worst screen. Bad camera. Volume key is not working properly. Only hype for the processor. May be a beast for the gaming section but fails miserably in other aspects. Didn't go for Samsung as they are running out of their products because of upgrading to 5G. But i should have waited instead of rushing into Poco. My bad.
Horrible,Worst cemera
Horrible,The hardware of the device is awesome but the MIUI is the worst ui i have ever seen.
Terrific,Nice 👍

Worthless,Touch problem after 10 days . My touch is not working smooth at one place of screan it's not  working.
Horrible,Please don't buy this mobile as it sounds like a chaina set not valuable for that price. Speaker sound while we are on a call or playing a video is unbearable and image of you play a song how much irritatable it would be. Plz don't buy  it I have used poco F1 for 1(1/2)years basing on its performance I choose to take this mobile  but to be frank there is lot of difference in performance to this and that one and I raised a return issue and Flipkart without considering the customer concern they...
Wonderful,Performance of this device is very good. If miui optimises his os then it will be bug free. You can play PUBG easily on this upto 55-60 fps easily on sanhok bootcamp

The real problem starts after the return period ends,"First of all, the phone is superb, in all aspects. It is very powerful and indeed a very good phone. But my unit started having problems with the speaker after 2 weeks. The speaker volume (on the top) started deteriorating and now for all calls, I need to use speaker mode while taking a call.

Slightly disappointed,Phone is fast. New Updates are ok. The screen does not have any palm rejection at all. Camera is below average. Very good for playing PUBG.Lots and lots of bloatware which can not be uninstalled. Many Chinese security/cleaner apps do run in the background all the time. These apps are banned in India but many are still integrated in the phones software.I am giving only 2 starts due to bloatware.

You can either record mannually each call Or you can record unknown numbers only. contacts you add to the recording list will be recorded auto no option for auto recording all calls. It is annoying if you work in office because sometimes u need to listen again what was the directions and if u forget to record then it's painful. 2. ...

Waste of money!,"This mobile is built using low quality materials. Don't buy if you need mobile not for gaming. They compromised all the components for the processor. Because of the high call volume, your ears will burn if speak for long and there is no fix for this. The back panel vibrates heavily and you will feel pain. Now a days, flipkart rejects all the replacement requests using the third party vendors. Fraud guy's."

Does the job,It's after months of use review. I am not satisfied with the mobile at it's price range. Cam is unsatisfactory and some times it's under performing. Poco is not recommended if your budget is above 10K. Better not to go with this.
