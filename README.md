- ðŸ‘‹"Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans"
This quote sums up my approach towards life, I am an eloquent planner but when or if things go south, I always find solutions.
 I am currently working as a Systems Engineer at Infosys. I enjoy coding and all the underlying math that comes with it. When not at work, You can find me on a football pitch.

I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to write to me at adityajoethomas@gmail.com :)
